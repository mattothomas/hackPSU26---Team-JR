      Assign exactly one concrete Week 1 task per team member.

      CRITICAL CONSTRAINT: Every task must produce a document, artifact, or piece of code that can be written right now.
      This is a pre-launch startup with no live product and no real users yet.
      NEVER assign tasks that require a live product, real users, or real-world actions. Forbidden examples:
      - "Acquire X users" or "Get beta signups" — there is no product to sign up for yet
      - "Run a marketing campaign" — there is no audience yet
      - "Onboard customers" — there are no customers yet
      - "Analyze user feedback" — there is no feedback yet
      - "Set up sales calls" — there is no pipeline yet

        - Business: ${JSON.stringify(business)}

        IMPORTANT: Produce the ACTUAL deliverable — not a description of what you would make.
        Write the real thing. Examples:
        - Engineer → write actual working code (routes, schemas, functions)
        - PM → write an actual PRD with real feature specs and user stories
        - Marketer → write actual ad copy, taglines, email sequences
        - Designer → write an actual design spec with component details and UX flows
        - Analyst → write an actual analysis with real numbers and projections

        CRITICAL: This startup has no live product and no real users yet. Do not produce deliverables that assume otherwise.
        Never write things like "reach out to 20 users", "analyze signup data", or "run ads" — none of that exists yet.
        Everything you produce must be a document, plan, code file, or written artifact you can create from scratch right now.

        Be specific to ${startupName}. Never write generic placeholder content.
